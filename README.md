## My projects through the CS255 Systems Analysis and Design Course

### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass was a company that desired to build an online system that allowed users to study and prepare themselves to pass their drivers license examinations. DriverPass's system allowed for the purchasing of drivers education packages as well as the scheduling of online or in-person drivers education training. Their goal was to increase the amount of people who pass their drivers license exams the first time, as well as inform their users of any changes to laws the DMV might have implemented recently.

### What did you do particularly well?
In this project, I believe I most successfully designed and implemented the business requirements to be as specific and effective as possible. I spent a lot of time thinking and organizing my functional and nonfunctional system requirements and gauged the different assumptions and limitations that might hold the DriverPass system back.

###If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I feel like I should have spent more time on my UML class diagrams for this project. While I believe their designs to meet the standards that were set out by my client, I believe that defining and implementing UML methods would have improved the creation and implementation of my system as software.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I was able to interpret the user's needs by having discussions with the client, taking notes of feautres they would like implemented and what the goals for their system are, and putting all of these ideas and studies into a Business Requirements document. With this document, I was able to create different UML diagrams that display different use cases, activites, sequences, and classes that will be used in the system.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I prefer to use the Agile approach to designing software. That includes gathering information, planning, designing, developing, testing, implementing, maintaining, and then eventually retiring the software. In the future, depending on the project, SCRUM methodologies would be implemented and used to ensure that functioning products are delivered frequently and that customers are consistently satisfied.
